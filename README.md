## <a name="testing"></a> Testing

This project uses **Jest**, **ESLint**, and **Prettier**.

-   **JEST** for test scripts :
    -   Run `npm test` or `npx jest` to execute all tests written in the `/tests` folder. This will output all errors and a coverage report.
-   **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting :
    -   Run `npx eslint path/to/your/file` to check for code errors.

## <a name="cicd"></a> CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate unit tests and create new releases.

-   **CI** is triggered when you push commits to the `develop` branch. It runs all unit tests.

-   To automatically run **CD** actions, follow these steps:

    -   Merge your current working branch into the `develop` branch.
    -   Create a new pull request (PR) to merge `develop` into `main`.
    -   Don't forget to update de `CHANGELOG.md` file before your `devlop` into `main` PR
    -   Locally in your terminal, switch to the `main` branch:
        ```sh
        git checkout main
        ```
    -   Pull the latest changes from `main`:
        ```sh
        git pull origin main
        ```
    -   Create a new tag:
        ```sh
        git tag -a x.x.x -m "Release version x.x.x"
        ```
    -   Push the new tag:
        ```sh
        git push origin x.x.x
        ```

    After these steps, the release should be automatically created.

-   If you need to delete a local and remote tag, use the following commands:
    -   List all tags:
        ```sh
        git tag
        ```
    -   Delete the local tag:
        ```sh
        git tag -d x.x.x
        ```
    -   Delete the remote tag:
        ```sh
        git push origin :refs/tags/x.x.x
        ```

## <a name="docker"></a> Docker

The app is divided into three images: one for the backend, one for the frontend, and one for the database.

You can run the app in Docker with `docker-compose up --build`.

To stop run `docker-compose down`

## <a name="documentation"></a> Documentation

This project uses **JSDoc** and **apidoc** to generate documentation.

-   **JSDoc**: Move to `/backend` folder, run `npm run doc` to generate documentation for the `/data` files.
-   **apidoc**: Move to `/backend` folder, for API documentation written in the `/services/api.js` file, run `npm run apidoc`.
