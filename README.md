-   React 18.3.1
-   Docker

## <a name="how-to-run-the-app"></a> How to run the app

-   Install **Node.js 18** and **npm** :

```bash
# Add the NodeSource repository for Node.js 18.x
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -

# Update the package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Node.js (which includes npm)
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# Verify the installation
node -v
npm -v
```

-   Install **PostgreSQL 15** :

```bash
# Add the PostgreSQL APT repository

echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list

# Import the repository signing key

wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the package list

sudo apt-get update

# Install PostgreSQL 15

sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-15

# Verify the installation
psql --version
```

-   Install **pgAdmin4** to manage the database, please follow official doc at https://www.pgadmin.org/download/pgadmin-4-apt/
-   Create a new database and run `database_script.sql` in **pgAdmin4** in SQL query field

For Linux/Debian OS, after installing pgadmin4 and postgreSQL you need to set password for postgres user. Besure to set the same password in your `.env` file.

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```bash
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';
```

To start a new server in pgadmin4, create a new server, add `127.0.0.1` to hostname, with postgres user and the password you set previous step, then click on save. Now to database and the server are running.

#### Configure the .env file

Create a .env file in the root of your backend project and add the following content, replacing newpassword with the password you set for the postgres user:

```bash
NODE_ENV=development
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=EffiTech
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
PORT=3001
JWT_SECRET=your_randomly_generated_token
```

For `JWT_SECRET`, generate a random token and replace your_randomly_generated_token with it. You can use a command like the following to generate a secure token:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

#### Install project dependencies

```bash
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

#### Start the PostgreSQL server

Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running :

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgresql
```

To launch the app run :

```bash
cd backend
npm start

cd frontend
npm start
```

And access the application at http://localhost:3000

## <a name="testing"></a> Testing

This project uses **Jest**, **ESLint**, and **Prettier**.

-   **JEST** for test scripts :
    -   Run `npm test` or `npx jest` to execute all tests written in the `/tests` folder. This will output all errors and a coverage report.
-   **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code quality and formatting :
    -   Run `npx eslint path/to/your/file` to check for code errors.

## <a name="cicd"></a> CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automate unit tests and create new releases.

-   **CI** is triggered when you push commits to the `develop` branch. It runs all unit tests.

-   To automatically run **CD** actions, follow these steps:

    -   Merge your current working branch into the `develop` branch.
    -   Create a new pull request (PR) to merge `develop` into `main`.
    -   Don't forget to update de `CHANGELOG.md` file before your `devlop` into `main` PR
    -   Locally in your terminal, switch to the `main` branch:
        ```sh
        git checkout main
        ```
    -   Pull the latest changes from `main`:
        ```sh
        git pull origin main
        ```
    -   Create a new tag:
        ```sh
        git tag -a x.x.x -m "Release version x.x.x"
        ```
    -   Push the new tag:
        ```sh
        git push origin x.x.x
        ```

    After these steps, the release should be automatically created.

-   If you need to delete a local and remote tag, use the following commands:
    -   List all tags:
        ```sh
        git tag
        ```
    -   Delete the local tag:
        ```sh
        git tag -d x.x.x
        ```
    -   Delete the remote tag:
        ```sh
        git push origin :refs/tags/x.x.x
        ```

## <a name="docker"></a> Docker

The app is divided into three images: one for the backend, one for the frontend, and one for the database.

You can run the app in Docker with `docker-compose up --build`.

To stop run `docker-compose down`

## <a name="documentation"></a> Documentation

This project uses **JSDoc** and **apidoc** to generate documentation.

-   **JSDoc**: Move to `/backend` folder, run `npm run doc` to generate documentation for the `/data` files.
-   **apidoc**: Move to `/backend` folder, for API documentation written in the `/services/api.js` file, run `npm run apidoc`.
